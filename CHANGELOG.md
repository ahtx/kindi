# Changelog

## 0.4.0 (2026-11-04)

### New

- **Speculative decoding by default on tensor-core cards.** On NVIDIA sm_80 and later, the installer sets
  `KINDI_SPEC=auto`. The 27B uses the 2B as its draft model: k=2 below 1K tokens of context, k=3 from 1K. On an
  RTX 3080 at 190 W, the 27B writes 1.46 times as fast at 512 tokens of context and 1.82 times as fast at 8K. The
  output is the same as without speculation. [docs/MTP.md](docs/MTP.md) gives the measurements.
- **An MTP head for the 2B.** `kindi-mtp-2b-v1.npz` drafts tokens for Ternary-Bonsai-2-2B, up to 8K tokens of context
  (about 1.1 times as fast). The installer downloads it from
  [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/ahtx/kindi-mtp-heads) and checks its sha256.
- **The Tesla P100 (sm_60) is a supported card.** The 27B writes 36.0 tokens/s on one P100 (SXM2, 300 W) at 512 tokens, against
  18.7 for llama.cpp on the same card. A new fp16 prompt path is on by default for sm_60 (`KINDI_P100_FP16_PROMPT=0`
  turns it off). With it, Kindi reads prompts 12% to 14% faster than llama.cpp. Speculation is off on the P100. The
  33B runs on two P100 cards at about 2.2 times the speed of llama.cpp. [docs/CARDS.md](docs/CARDS.md) has the numbers.
- **The GeForce RTX 20, 30, 40 and 50 series.** All four series are supported. `kindi verify` passes on them. The
  speed numbers are in [docs/BENCHMARKS.md](docs/BENCHMARKS.md) for the cards that we measured.
- **AH-Nanbeige4.3-33B IQ3_XXS.** Kindi has a backend for AH-Nanbeige4.3-33B IQ3_XXS (our IQ3_XXS quantization of Nanbeige4.3-33B, made with bartowski's imatrix). It puts the layers on one or more NVIDIA
  cards (two RTX 3080, two Tesla P100, one RTX 3090), and on a Quadro K6000 with layers in host memory (3.56 tokens/s at 8K, 1.52 for llama.cpp). Use `kindi use nanbeige-33b` or `install.sh --model nanbeige`. On two RTX 3080 cards, it writes 45.5
  tokens/s, and llama.cpp writes 32.3 with the same file. Prompt lookup is on by default (2 times as fast on copy and edit
  work). In an initial test of 115 tasks, the 33B solves 98 and the 27B solves 96. Model card:
  https://huggingface.co/ahtx/AH-Nanbeige4.3-33B-IQ3_XXS-GGUF
- **A start-up self-check for the 33B.** The AH-Nanbeige4.3-33B server checks itself at start-up. If the check
  fails, the server stops, so the service restarts it before it gives a wrong reply.
- **Sampler settings.** Requests can set `min_p`, `repeat_penalty` and `repeat_last_n` (#4).
- **Pinned checkpoints.** `KINDI_CKPT_PINNED` keeps the host copies of the prompt-cache checkpoints in pinned
  memory. It is on by default under WSL2 (#4).

### Changed

- The speculation guard works from 32K tokens of context (`KINDI_SPEC_GUARD_FROM`). Below 32K, speculation was
  faster on each card that we measured.
- The installer works with rootless Docker, and it checks `--gpus` before `kindi verify` (#8).
- The README tells what to do after the install: the port, `/health`, clients, curl and Python (#11).

### Fixed

- The CPU engine restores a cached state in place (#9).
- `kindi bench` times the CPU engine with the host clock when there is no CuPy (#10).
- A streaming request with a prompt that is too long gets HTTP 400 (`context_length_exceeded`) before the first
  byte. Before, the server sent HTTP 200 and then an error in the stream (#18).
- `kindi fast-head` works on a model with more than 4,096 hidden values, for example the 27B (1,280 threads in one
  block was more than the limit of 1,024) (#4).
- `/health` shows the head that runs. A model that has no fast head (the 27B, Nanbeige) shows `exact` also when
  `kindi head fast` was set (#4).
- The installer finds the compute capability of the Tesla K10 and K20 (Kepler) and of the GTX TITAN X (Maxwell,
  sm_52) from the card name. The Quadro K2000 and K4000 are no longer taken for a K20 and a K40 (#19).

## 0.3.0 (2026-10-28)

### New

- **AMD Radeon 780M graphics.** A ROCm image (`docker/Dockerfile.rocm`) runs the 2B, the 27B and Nemotron on the
  780M. The installer finds the card and builds the image. [docs/AMD.md](docs/AMD.md) gives the settings.
- **Quadro K6000.** The installer runs the 27B on this 12 GB Kepler card. [docs/CARDS.md](docs/CARDS.md) gives the
  settings.
- **NVIDIA Nemotron 3.5 Bolt E4B (experimental).** Kindi has its own decoder for this model, with tool calls and
  thinking. It runs on one card, or on two cards of the same kind in tensor parallel. Use `--model nemotron` with
  the installer.
- **More prompt cache.** Nemotron has its own prompt cache (`KINDI_G4_PROMPT_CACHE`). With the Bonsai models, the
  server can also resume a request inside a parked conversation (`KINDI_PARK_BRANCH`, on by default on ROCm).
  `KINDI_PROMPT_CACHE=0` turns the Bonsai cache off. [docs/PROMPT-CACHE.md](docs/PROMPT-CACHE.md) gives the
  results, and `examples/prompt_cache_bench.py` is the test.
- **A setup menu.** The installer shows each setup that the machine supports, the recommended setup first.
  `--auto` takes the recommended setup. `--config N,M` runs several setups side by side, and `--config NxK` runs
  one setup on K cards of the same kind. Each server gets its own container and port.
- **CPU servers next to GPU servers.** The installer offers a 2B server on the CPU on each machine.
- **gpu-unlock.** The installer finds the GeForce RTX 30 cards that NVIDIA limits to half-rate 16-bit arithmetic.
  It offers to unlock them with the [gpu-unlock](https://github.com/Zagitta/gpu-unlock) module by Zagitta. It never
  does this without a question.
- **`kindi models` and `kindi use`.** A model catalog, the models that fit this machine, and a resumable download
  with a sha256 check.

### Changed

- Sampling uses the order of llama.cpp by default: top-k, top-p, then temperature.
- The server returns OpenAI `logprobs` and `top_logprobs` for Nemotron.
- With the 2B draft model, a guard stops speculation when it is slower than plain steps (`KINDI_SPEC_GUARD=0` turns
  the guard off).
- The installer detects a server that restarts in a loop, and it checks that the Kindi modules load after the build.
- The installer makes one pi provider for each server.
- On a 2 GB Kepler card, the installer asks for a context of 23,808 tokens for the 4B. This is the context that fits.

### Fixed

- `model_name = auto` also reads the model size from the GGUF file name. Before, a 27B pack could report
  `bonsai2-2b`.
- `/health` shows a git commit only for a Kindi checkout. Before, a copy of Kindi in another git folder showed the
  commit of that folder.
- The installer works on machines with one GPU and with Kepler workstation cards.
- The cache brings a parked conversation back in place, and the server continues after an engine error.
- The tensor-core path starts on cards after the RTX 30 series (RTX 40, RTX 50 and Hopper). Before, the 27B
  with the installer's tensor-core profile and the Nemotron model stopped at start-up with `CUDA_ERROR_INVALID_PTX`.
- Kindi starts on RTX 50 cards. Before, no kernel compiled on these cards, because CuPy compared the card versions
  as text.

## 0.2.0 (2026-10-22)

### New

- **More models and cards.** Kindi runs Ternary-Bonsai-2-2B, -4B, -9B and -27B (the PTQ1_0 GGUFs). Tested on the
  Quadro K420 (1 GB and 2 GB), the Quadro K1200 (one card, or two in tensor parallel), the GeForce GTX 1080, the
  GeForce RTX 3080 and the CPU. [docs/CARDS.md](docs/CARDS.md) gives the settings for each card.
- **A one-command installer** (`install.sh`, [docs/INSTALL.md](docs/INSTALL.md)). It finds the cards, selects the
  model and the settings, downloads the model and checks its sha256, converts it, runs `kindi verify` and starts the
  server as a Docker service. It works with the NVIDIA Container Toolkit or without it. `--dry-run` shows each
  command. A re-run upgrades or repairs, and `--uninstall [--purge]` removes Kindi.
- **The 27B.** A plan engine (`kindi/tp.py`) runs it on one card (GTX 1080 8 GB, RTX 3080) or on two cards (2x
  Quadro K1200, tensor parallel). The K/V cache is q8_0, as llama.cpp `-ctk q8_0 -ctv q8_0`.
- **Prompts in chunks.** The engine reads up to 256 prompt tokens in one pass. The tokens are the same as with one
  token at a time. `KINDI_CHUNK=0` turns it off.
- **5-trit weights** on Pascal and later (1.75 bits per weight). The GTX 1080 holds the 27B with a context of 65,536
  tokens.
- **RTX 3080 (sm_80 and later):** int8 tensor-core products and CUDA graphs (`KINDI_TC=1`), split flash-decode
  attention (`KINDI_FD=1`) and tensor-core attention for the prompt chunks (`KINDI_ATT_TC=1`). `KINDI_SPEC=draft2b`
  uses the 2B as a draft model; the greedy output is the same as without it.
- **A CPU engine** (`KINDI_DEVICE=cpu`) for the 2B, 4B and 9B. It is token-exact with llama.cpp and needs no CUDA.
- **Checkpoints in card memory** (`KINDI_CKPT_VRAM=1`, one card): the copy to the host waits until the server is
  idle.
- **`/health` shows the version and the source commit.** `kindi verify` uses the reference of the pack's model.
- **[docs/BENCHMARKS.md](docs/BENCHMARKS.md)** compares Kindi and llama.cpp on the same card, with the same model
  file and the same context.

### Changed

- The context length fits the free card memory (`KINDI_MEM_RESERVE_MB`).
- The prompt cache: the memory budget counts every checkpoint and every parked conversation, and there is a
  checkpoint at the end of the opening. Saved openings belong to one engine configuration, and the server does not
  resume an opening of another configuration. A damaged opening file does not stop a request.
- Blocking sync: while it waits for the card, the host thread sleeps and does not keep a CPU core busy. It is on by
  default on CUDA (`KINDI_BLOCKING_SYNC=0` turns it off). It costs 1-3% of the decode speed, so the installer turns
  it off for one server on its own card.
- Before the 27B loads on two cards, the engine checks the free host RAM and stops with a clear message when it is
  too small (`KINDI_HOST_RAM_CHECK=0` skips the check).
- `model_name = auto` (the default) takes the model id from the pack.
- The K420 comparison in the documentation now uses the same model file for llama.cpp (PTQ1_0). The 0.1.0 page used
  llama.cpp's Q2_0 file. With the PTQ1_0 file, llama.cpp generates 1.65 tokens/s on the K420; Kindi generates 20.8.

### Fixed

- The fast head always scores the special tokens (`</think>` and the end tokens). Before, it could fail to close
  the thinking.
- Host memory: the server frees the CuPy pinned-memory pool after the load, and freed checkpoints go back to the
  system. Before, a server grew with each request.

## 0.1.0 - first public release

- License: GNU AGPL-3.0. Commercial licenses are available (see COMMERCIAL-LICENSE.md).
- An engine for Ternary-Bonsai-2-2B on the NVIDIA Quadro K420. It generates 20.8 tokens/s with the exact head and
  23 tokens/s with the fast head. It reads prompts at 26.5 tokens/s. The context is 24,576 tokens in 1 GB.
- With the exact head, the output is token-for-token identical to llama.cpp (`kindi verify`).
- `kindi convert` makes an exact conversion from the PTQ1_0 GGUF.
- An OpenAI-compatible server with chat completions, streams, tool calls, an optional API key and live progress in
  `/health`.
- Thinking mode: the server sends the thinking as `reasoning_content` (in a stream, as `delta.reasoning_content`).
  `thinking_budget_tokens` sets a limit. At the limit, the server closes the thinking and the model gives its answer.
- When `max_tokens` stops a reply in the middle of a tool call, the server returns that text. The client can then
  see that the reply is not complete.
- A prompt cache: checkpoints of the recurrent state, parked conversations in RAM and saved openings on disk.
- An optional fast (shortlist) output head. You can change the head at run time (`kindi head`).
- A Docker image with the CUDA 10.2 / CuPy 9.6 stack that Kepler needs.
- When a client disconnects (timeout, Ctrl-C), the server stops the request at the next token. This is also true
  during a long prompt read.
