# How to run Kindi on each card

The installer ([INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md)) uses these settings. It selects them from the cards that it finds.

Blocking sync (`KINDI_BLOCKING_SYNC`, on by default) lets the host thread sleep while it waits for the card. It
costs 2-3% of the decode speed on the GTX 1080. With one server on its own card, set `KINDI_BLOCKING_SYNC=0`
(the installer does this). The RTX 3080 profile keeps it on: there, many servers share few CPU cores.

This page gives the settings for each tested card. It also gives the speeds that we measured with these settings.
All the cards use the same Docker image (CUDA 10.2, CuPy 9.6). The `kindi` folder of this repository is the code.

To make a pack, use `kindi convert` (see the README). Put the pack in `$HOME/.kindi/<pack>`. In the container, it
is at `/data/<pack>`. The examples serve on `127.0.0.1:8093`.

```
docker run -d --name kindi --restart unless-stopped --gpus all -u $(id -u):$(id -g) \
  -p 127.0.0.1:8093:8093 -v $HOME/.kindi:/data -e HOME=/tmp \
  -e KINDI_PACK=/data/pack -e KINDI_STATE_DIR=/data/state ... kindi:0.1.0
```

Replace `...` with the variables in the section for your card. To use one card of two, set `--gpus device=N`.

## Quadro K420, 1 GB (Kepler, sm_30)

| item | value |
|---|---|
| model | Ternary-Bonsai-2-2B |
| variables | `KINDI_CTX=24576` (the default) |
| generation | 20.8 tokens/s (exact head), about 23 tokens/s (fast head) |
| prompt reading | 31.6 tokens/s at 3K tokens, 28.1 at 12K (one token at a time: 25.3 and 23.4; dev build of 10-21) |

- The prompt path uses chunks of 128 tokens on this card. Then the context stays at 24,576 tokens.
- To read prompts one token at a time, set `KINDI_CHUNK=0`.

## Quadro K420, 2 GB (Kepler, sm_30)

| item | value |
|---|---|
| model | Ternary-Bonsai-2-2B (or the 4B with `KINDI_PACK=/data/pack4b`) |
| variables | `KINDI_CTX=65536` for the 2B, `KINDI_CTX=24576` for the 4B |
| generation | 2B: 21.2 tokens/s (exact head), 24.8 (fast head); 4B: 9.8 tokens/s |

## Quadro K4000, 3 GB (Kepler, sm_30)

| item | value |
|---|---|
| models | 2B (`/data/pack`), 4B (`/data/pack4b`) or 9B (`/data/pack9b`); `kindi verify` is ALL PASS on the three |
| variables | `KINDI_CTX=65536` for the 2B, `KINDI_CTX=24576` for the 4B, `KINDI_CTX=12032` with `KINDI_MEM_RESERVE_MB=256` for the 9B |
| generation | 2B: 63.3 tokens/s at 512 tokens (exact head), 48.4 at 24K; 4B: 30.3 and 22.1; 9B: 18.2 at 512 and 16.4 at 11.9K |
| prompt reading | 2B: 122.1 tokens/s at 512 tokens, 108.9 at 8K, 89.5 at 24K (one token at a time: 78.0); 4B: 47.3, 41.8, 33.9; 9B: 26.2 at 512 and 24.4 at 8K |

- Four SMX. The prompt path uses chunks of 128 tokens on this card, as on the K420.
- 65,536 tokens leaves 1,664 MiB of the 3 GB free; 131,072 loads and runs with 876 MiB free.
- The 4B fits 50,688 tokens with `KINDI_MEM_RESERVE_MB=256`; 49,152 leaves 259 MiB.
- The 9B fits 12,032 tokens with `KINDI_MEM_RESERVE_MB=256` (208 MiB free), and 17,152 with the default
  reserve of 96 MB (46 MiB free). Use 12,032.
- `KINDI_BLOCKING_SYNC=0` makes no measurable difference here: 64.2 tokens/s with and without.
- The card reports as `Quadro K4000`; the installer picks the Kepler profile for it.
- The card is sm_30, so llama.cpp runs with Vulkan here (see [BENCHMARKS.md](BENCHMARKS.md)): at 128 tokens its
  prompt path already reads at 1.28 tokens/s.

## Quadro K1200, 4 GB (Maxwell, sm_50)

| item | value |
|---|---|
| models | 2B (`/data/pack`), 4B (`/data/pack4b`) or 9B (`/data/pack9b`) |
| variables | `KINDI_CTX=24576` |
| generation (exact / fast head) | 2B 71.6 / 88.3 tokens/s, 4B 35.0 / 42.2, 9B 20.7 / 24.9 |
| prompt reading at 3K tokens | 2B 186.6 tokens/s, 4B 74.5, 9B 40.0 |

- The card in an x16 slot is faster than the card in an x4 slot.

## Two Quadro K1200 cards (tensor parallel)

| item | value |
|---|---|
| model | Ternary-Bonsai-2-27B (`/data/pack27b`) |
| variables | `KINDI_PACK=/data/pack27b`, `KINDI_CTX=24576`, `KINDI_HEAD=exact`, `KINDI_CHECKPOINT_BUDGET_MB=4096`, `KINDI_REPEAT_STOP=1` |
| docker | `--gpus all` (the engine uses both cards), `--memory 12g` |
| generation | 12.6 tokens/s |
| prompt reading | 20.9 tokens/s at 512 tokens, 18.4 at 22K (dev code of 10-21, the chunk-path copy) |

- The K/V cache is q8_0. The output matches llama.cpp with `-ctk q8_0 -ctv q8_0`.
- Set the host to text mode. A desktop session turns on the CUDA watchdog, and the watchdog stops the exchange
  kernels.

## GeForce GTX 1080, 8 GB (Pascal, sm_61)

| item | value |
|---|---|
| model | Ternary-Bonsai-2-27B |
| variables | `KINDI_PACK=/data/pack27b`, `KINDI_CARDS=1`, `KINDI_CTX=65536`, `KINDI_HEAD=exact`, `KINDI_REPEAT_STOP=1`, `KINDI_MAX_TOKENS=65536` |
| generation | 28.4 tokens/s at a short context, 16.0 at 60K |
| prompt reading | 249 tokens/s at 512 tokens, 237 at 3K, 213 at 12K, 188 at 22K |

- The first start writes the 5-trit weights into the pack (`g5n_*.bin`, 5.6 GB). This takes about 12 minutes.
  Later starts take about 30 seconds.
- The prompt products use int8 activations on this card. For fp32, set `KINDI_CHUNK_Q8=0` (110 tokens/s at 512
  tokens).
- On a host with more than one GPU, set `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` to the GTX 1080.

## GeForce RTX 3080, 10 GB (Ampere, sm_86)

| item | value |
|---|---|
| model | Ternary-Bonsai-2-27B |
| variables | `KINDI_PACK=/data/pack27b`, `KINDI_CARDS=1`, `KINDI_CTX=131072`, `KINDI_MEM_RESERVE_MB=128`, `KINDI_HEAD=exact`, `KINDI_CHECKPOINT_BUDGET_MB=1024`, `KINDI_PARK_MAX=1`, `KINDI_REPEAT_STOP=1` |
| docker | `--memory 14g` (the first load needs it) |
| context | 110,592 tokens (the fit to the free memory) |
| generation | 47-49 tokens/s at a short context, 29 at 64K |
| prompt reading | 491 tokens/s at 512 tokens, 381 at 22K |

These figures are from kindi-rel, 10-21, not the 0.2.0 build.

Tensor cores and speculative decoding (sm_80 and later). This is the profile of the RTX 3080 cluster servers, and
the installer uses it:

| variable | value | |
|---|---|---|
| `KINDI_TC` | `1` | int8 tensor-core products and CUDA graphs for the decode |
| `KINDI_FD` | `1` | split flash-decode attention: the K/V is read once per query, in chunks of 512 positions |
| `KINDI_ATT_TC` | `1` | the attention of the prompt chunks on the tensor cores |
| `KINDI_SPEC` | `draft2b` | speculative decoding with the 2B as the draft model (also `ngram` or `both`). Off by default |
| `KINDI_SPEC_K` | `3` | the draft tokens per verify pass (default 4) |
| `KINDI_SPEC_PACK` | the 2B pack | for `draft2b` (for example `/data/pack2b`) |
| `KINDI_SPEC_WINDOW` | `8192` | the context of the draft model |
| `KINDI_TC_TMAX` | `4` | the most tokens in one verify pass |
| `KINDI_CKPT_VRAM` | `1` | a checkpoint is a copy in card memory; its copy to the host waits until the server is idle |
| `KINDI_MEM_RESERVE_MB` | `160` | the memory that the CUDA graphs need after the context fit |
| `KINDI_DENSE_SPACING` | `2048` | the spacing of the checkpoints in the opening of a conversation |
| `KINDI_CHECKPOINT_BUDGET_MB` | `1280` | the host memory for checkpoints and parked conversations (`1024` on the agent servers) |
| `KINDI_PARK_MAX` | `1` | parked conversations (`0` on the agent servers: one conversation each) |
| `KINDI_PREFIX_MAX` | `2` | saved openings on disk |

With this profile: context 84,992 tokens; at 190 W on agent prompts 99.9 tokens/s greedy and 91.3 sampled; prompt
reading 1,093 tokens/s at 512 to 855 at 22K.

- With `KINDI_TC=1`, the server reads prompts in passes of up to `KINDI_TC_TMAX` tokens.
- Speculative greedy output is the same as the output without speculation.
- The cluster runs seven servers on one 4-core host with `--memory 6g`. One server on a computer of its own can use
  the default budgets.

## CPU (x86-64 with AVX2)

| item | value |
|---|---|
| models | 2B, 4B or 9B |
| variables | `KINDI_DEVICE=cpu`, `OMP_NUM_THREADS=<cores of one socket>`, `OMP_PROC_BIND=close`, `OMP_PLACES=cores` |

- The CPU engine needs gcc with OpenMP. It builds `libkcpu.so` at the first start (`KINDI_CPU_CACHE`).
- The output is token-exact with llama.cpp.
